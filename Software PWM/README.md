Lab 4 Software PWM

In order to create the software PWM, the pins are configured to have P1.0 hooked to an LED connected as an output initialized at 0. Then the button, P1.1, has a pullup resistor and has interrupts enabled on the falling edge when the button is depressed. In an infinite loop, The PWM value initialized at 500 is compared with the TB0R register holding the timer's current value. If it is lower than the threshold, the LED is flipped and if it is greater, the LED is off. The button interrupt is used to increase the threshold value for PWM until it reaches 1000 then drops back to zero. The button interrupt uses a different clock than the one controlling the LED in order to opperate at different frequencies. with the Timer interrupt, The state determines how the flag is reset for the button interrupt.
