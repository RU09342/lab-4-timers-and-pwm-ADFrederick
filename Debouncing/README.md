Lab 4 Debouncing

In previous labs such as the button interrupt, debouncing was achieved through the use of delayed cycles. This is an issue however due to the processing time it takes. When the porcessor is delaying cycles, it is running NOPS which mean it can not run anything else. Now that we are able to use timers and interrupts, we can use better software debouncing which does not use of precious clock cycles.
To make this work, the LED is set as an output and the button is setup with a pullup resistor. The timer is setup to reset at 0xFFFF by running in continuous mode and the timer interrupt occurs at the reset from 0xFFFF to 0x0000. Through this setup, the button is pressed but the flag is not removed until the interrupt is disabled and then it is reenabled after the timer goes off again.
