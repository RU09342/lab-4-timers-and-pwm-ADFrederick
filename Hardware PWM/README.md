Lab 4 HW PWM

In order to create the Hardware PWM, The use of the timer inputs was integral. I started by defining which pins would be attached to TA0.1 so that the LED would follow the signal from the CCR0/1 Set/Reset cycle. Then I defined the Button to interrupt and used the ISR to control a case statement cycling frough CCR1 values in order to adjust the duty cycle of the LED. This hardware PWM allows us to just utilize the outmodes and timer built in without needing to define when the LED is switched. In order for this to function as coded, The LED must be connected to the LED through the pin connected to TA0.1.
